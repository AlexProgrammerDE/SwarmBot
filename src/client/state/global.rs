    /// # Goal
    /// we want to assign regions to explore for each bot
    /// we want to explore in rings
    ///
    /// ```
    /// 33333
    /// 32223
    /// 32123
    /// 32223
    /// 33333
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Think of this as a priority queue where low numbers have a higher priority. It is easy to connect all regions
    /// because the chunks loaded are in a square in Minecraft and not a circle. Therefore, we can make sure sections
    /// will not collide.
    ///
    /// # Assignment
    /// ## Initial
    /// Initially, this will just be a priority queue. All bots will get assigned a slot and walk to it
    ///
    /// ## Next Step
    /// A na√Øve approach would be always taking the region with the least priority and breaking ties with distance.
    /// However, assume a bot is at an x and the last remaining region at the tie-breaking priority is an o
    /// ```
    /// ..x
    /// ...
    /// o..
    /// ```
    ///
    /// This would be a long traversal. In addition, assume  this was a thousand blocks away. This would take a lot of extra time. Ideally we would
    /// have a bot that will finish the task in a little period of time go to it. Instead we will have bots choose the smallest priority adjacent to
    /// it else if there are no adj the closest next smallest. Let's see how this would play out
    ///
    ///```
    /// 4321.
    /// 5..0.
    /// 6....
    /// 78...
    /// 9....
    ///```
    /// or equally likely
    ///
    ///```
    /// ...12
    /// ...03
    /// 3...4
    /// 12..5
    /// 09876
    ///```
    /// ## Data structure
    /// We want to make it easy for bots to follow the graph. Let us denote each grid as `(x,y)`, where the priority is `max(abs(x),abs(y))`
    ///
    ///```
    ///(-1, 1)(0, 1)(1, 1)
    ///(-1, 0)(0, 0)(1, 0)
    ///(-1,-1)(0,-1)(1,-1)

    ///
    /// We will use a HashMap for now though since it is simpler
    /// the lengths are 1, (3*3 - prev) = 8, (5*5) - prev = 17.
    /// There is a clock-wise wrapping where the top left is the first element.
